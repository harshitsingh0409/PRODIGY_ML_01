# House Price Prediction using Linear Regression
## Single Variable Approach
In the single variable approach, the house price is predicted based on a single feature, such as the area of the house. The linear regression model is trained using the historical data of house prices and their corresponding areas. Once trained, the model can be used to predict the price of a new house based on its area.

## Multiple Variable Approach
In the multiple variable approach, the house price is predicted based on multiple features, such as the area, number of bedrooms, and number of bathrooms. The linear regression model is trained using the historical data of house prices and their corresponding features. Once trained, the model can be used to predict the price of a new house based on its features.

## Dataset
The dataset used for training and testing the models is provided in the data folder. It contains information about various houses, including their prices and features.
## Tools & Technologies
Python
Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation
Scikit-Learn for building and evaluating the regression model
Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization

## Key Insights
Importance of feature selection and engineering
Impact of multicollinearity among features
Effectiveness of data visualization in understanding data patterns
